  - Name: Entrance
    Thoughts: 'Back in my days this used to be the entrance to my magnificent palace.
      Well, at least they did not dare to remove the carvings of my great idol of
      Alexander the great! He might even have been a tiny bit greater than me. '
    State: 
  - Name: 'Ceiling Murals '
    Thoughts: As you can see on this beautiful ceiling mural, I was a damn handsome
      guy. Justice was my right to serve and you justice reaching out to me to hold
      my hand. If you have not noticed by now, I am of course the person in the very
      middle. Just as the most important person should be.
    State: 
  - Name: 'Self Portrait '
    Thoughts: 'The ottomans were quite a nuisance, however nothing when compared
      to my own flesh and blood. My cousins would not get the message that I was
      the right person to rule them all, so they had to pay! '
    State: 
  - Name: Picture collection
    Thoughts: "Quite a sight to behold, isn\u2019t it? My collection is indeed one
      of a kind. It is okay to be jealous of me. I sincerely hope that no one dares
      to even think of touching these works of art! "
    State: 
  - Name: Audience room
    Thoughts: As every important person I of course had to take part in many audiences,
      which took place in my own audience room, where else did you think an audience
      would be held? Here you can see me having an, of course private, audience.
      I can not recall what exactly it was about, nor would I share such secrets
      with you, but rest assured it was something of significant importance!
    State: 
  - Name: 'Favorite pictures '
    Thoughts: "Ah yes, my favorite pictures of my whole collection. Please do not
      worry about that children\u2019s painting behind me, it is nothing of importance.
      So, which one of my pictures would you like to take a closer look at?"
